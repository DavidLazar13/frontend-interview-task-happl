# Happl Frontend Interview Task

For this task we'd like you to build the allowances list UI:

This isn't designed to take a huge amount of time, we're more interested in how you approach the task rather than the final result. It would be great if you could use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and add some [tests](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). You can find the designs on [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/NrNBzd7Qja4fuCmwMsOLVK/Frontend-Task). You'll need to create a figma account to view the full design details.

To get started fork this repository, and once completed send us an email with a link to your repository.

If you have any questions please feel free to email us.
